# Project-2-463

# Goal of the Project
**Objectives:** The primary objective of this project is to develop a system that analyzes crime data to predict future crime rates and determine the safest paths in a given area to avoid high-risk zones. The project leverages historical crime data to provide predictive insights and to implement a pathfinding algorithm that minimizes exposure to crime-prone areas.

# Significance of the Project
**Meaningfulness and Novelty:** This project is meaningful because it aims to enhance public safety by utilizing data analytics and algorithmic solutions to predict and avoid potential crime scenarios. Its novelty lies in the integration of crime data analysis with Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the safest routes, providing a practical application of academic concepts in a real-world scenario.

# Installation and Instruction to Use
**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries by running:
```bash pip install pandas heapq collections```

**Usage**
1. Place your crime dataset (in CSV format) in the same directory as the script.
2. ```bash python crime.py```
